Running Programs in Google Colab

To run the provided programs in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab: Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/.

2. Upload Notebooks and Datasets:
   - Upload 2 provided ".ipynb" files along with the required datasets ("iyer.txt" and "cho.txt").
   - Click on the "Upload" button and select the files from your local system.
   - Check the provided file path is correct, else add the correct path while reading file.

   - Files: DM P2 iyer.ipynb, DM P2 cho.ipynb, iyer.txt, cho.txt

3. Connect to a Runtime:
   - Go to "Runtime" in the menu bar.
   - Click on "Change runtime type".
   - Choose the appropriate hardware accelerator (CPU is sufficient for these programs).

4. Run All Cells:
   - Once the notebooks and datasets are uploaded, click on "Runtime" in the menu bar.
   - Select "Run all" from the dropdown menu.
   - This will execute all the cells in the notebook, generating the output.

5. Check Output:
   - After running all cells, you can check the output, which includes the results of the algorithms under the dataset text markdown.
   - Compare the output with the provided report to ensure correctness (all the left images are of Iyer's and all right images are of Cho's).
